## 💡 Tutorial Philosophy

These tutorials are designed around **natural conversation**, not code. You will learn to:

- **Ask questions** instead of writing commands
- **Describe what you want** instead of remembering syntax
- **Focus on biology** instead of technical details
- **Get instant results** instead of debugging code

## 🎯 How to Use These Tutorials

### For Structured Learning
1. **Choose your learning path** based on experience level (see above)
2. **Follow the guided progression** with time estimates and checkpoints
3. **Complete practice exercises** to reinforce concepts
4. **Track your progress** through learning objectives

### For Targeted Learning
1. **Browse individual tutorials** for specific techniques
2. **Follow the conversation examples** - they show real interactions  
3. **Try the suggested questions** with your own data
4. **Adapt the examples** to your specific research questions
