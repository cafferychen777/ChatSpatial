Discover what types of cells are in your tissue and where they're located.

**What you'll learn:**
- "What cell types are in my tissue?"
- Understanding marker gene expression
- Validating cell type assignments
- Visualizing cell type distributions spatially

### [Cell Communication Analysis](cell_communication_analysis.md)
Uncover how different cells talk to each other in your tissue.

**What you'll learn:**
- "How do my cells communicate?"
- Identifying ligand-receptor interactions
- Exploring spatial communication patterns
- Understanding biological significance

### [Creating Beautiful Visualizations](visualization_tutorial.md)
Make publication-ready figures through simple conversation.

**What you'll learn:**
- "Can you create a nice plot of my data?"
- Customizing colors, styles, and layouts
- Publication-ready figure generation
- Interactive and animated visualizations

## 💡 Tutorial Philosophy

These tutorials are designed around **natural conversation**, not code. You'll learn to:

- **Ask questions** instead of writing commands
- **Describe what you want** instead of remembering syntax
- **Focus on biology** instead of technical details
- **Get instant results** instead of debugging code

## 🎯 How to Use These Tutorials

1. **Start with [Basic Spatial Analysis](basic_spatial_analysis.md)** if you're new
2. **Follow the conversation examples** - they show real interactions
3. **Try the suggested questions** with your own data
4. **Adapt the examples** to your specific research questions
