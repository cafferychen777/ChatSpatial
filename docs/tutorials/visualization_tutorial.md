## Before You Start

### What You Need
- ✅ **Spatial data loaded** in ChatSpatial
- ✅ **Some analysis completed** (spatial domains, cell types, etc.)
- ✅ **Ideas about** what you want to visualize!

### No Design Skills Required!
ChatSpatial handles all the technical details of creating beautiful plots. You just need to describe what you want to see!

## Step 1: Basic Spatial Visualizations

### 💬 Starting with Simple Requests

---

**👤 You:** "I'd like to see my spatial data. Can you create a nice visualization showing the tissue structure?"

**🤖 ChatSpatial:** "Absolutely! Let me create a beautiful spatial overview of your tissue."

*[Stunning spatial plot appears]*

**🤖 ChatSpatial:** "Here's your tissue overview! 🎨

**What you're seeing:**
- Each dot represents a measurement spot
- Colors show total gene expression (UMI counts)
- Spatial coordinates preserve tissue architecture
- Color scale from blue (low) to red (high) expression

**Visual insights:**
- Your tissue has clear regional differences
- Some areas show much higher gene activity
- The spatial organization looks well-preserved
- No obvious technical artifacts

Would you like me to color this by something specific, like cell types or a particular gene?"

**👤 You:** "Yes! Can you show me the same tissue but colored by the spatial domains we identified earlier?"

**🤖 ChatSpatial:** "Perfect! Let me create a spatial domain visualization."

*[Beautiful domain-colored spatial plot appears]*

**🤖 ChatSpatial:** "Here's your tissue colored by spatial domains! 🌈

**Domain Organization:**
- **Domain 1** (blue): Cortical layers - organized neural tissue
- **Domain 2** (green): White matter - myelinated regions  
- **Domain 3** (red): Hippocampus - memory formation area
- **Domain 4** (yellow): Ventricular zone - stem cell regions
- **Domain 5** (purple): Boundary areas - transition zones

The colors clearly show how your tissue is organized into distinct functional regions. Each domain has its own biological identity!"

### 🎯 What Just Happened?

ChatSpatial automatically:
- ✅ Created publication-quality spatial plots
- ✅ Chose appropriate color schemes
- ✅ Added informative legends and labels
- ✅ Provided biological interpretation of visual patterns

## Step 2: Gene Expression Visualizations

### 💬 Exploring Specific Genes

---

**👤 You:** "This looks great! Now I'm curious about specific genes. Can you show me where GFAP is expressed in my tissue?"

**🤖 ChatSpatial:** "Excellent choice! GFAP is a key astrocyte marker. Let me visualize its expression pattern."

*[Gene expression spatial plot appears]*

**🤖 ChatSpatial:** "Here's GFAP expression across your tissue! 🧬

**Expression Pattern:**
- **High expression** (red/yellow): Scattered throughout gray matter
- **Moderate expression** (orange): Transition zones
- **Low expression** (blue): White matter and neuronal layers

**Biological Interpretation:**
This pattern is exactly what we'd expect for GFAP! It's marking astrocytes, which are:
- Abundant in gray matter (supporting neurons)
- Less common in white matter (mainly oligodendrocytes there)
- Present at tissue boundaries (maintaining structure)

The spatial pattern confirms healthy astrocyte distribution!"

**👤 You:** "That's fascinating! Can you show me multiple genes at once? I'd like to compare GFAP with some neuronal markers."

**🤖 ChatSpatial:** "Great idea! Let me create a multi-gene comparison panel."

*[Multi-panel gene expression plot appears]*

**🤖 ChatSpatial:** "Here's your gene expression comparison panel! 🔬

**Four-Gene Panel:**
- **GFAP** (top-left): Astrocyte marker - scattered distribution
- **MAP2** (top-right): Neuronal marker - layer-specific pattern
- **MBP** (bottom-left): Oligodendrocyte marker - white matter enriched
- **IBA1** (bottom-right): Microglia marker - evenly distributed

**Comparative Insights:**
- **Complementary patterns**: Each gene marks different cell types
- **Spatial segregation**: Clear tissue organization visible
- **Expected biology**: All patterns match known cell distributions
- **Tissue health**: Normal cellular architecture preserved

This multi-gene view beautifully shows how different cell types organize your tissue!"

Each plot reveals different aspects of your tissue organization!"

**👤 You:** "Wow, these are all so informative! Can you create a summary figure that combines the most important visualizations for a presentation?"

**🤖 ChatSpatial:** "Perfect! Let me create a comprehensive summary figure."

*[Beautiful multi-panel summary figure appears]*

**🤖 ChatSpatial:** "Here's your presentation-ready summary figure! 🎯

**Panel Layout:**
