What Are Learning Paths?
-------------------------

Learning paths are curated sequences of tutorials and exercises designed to take you from your current skill level to your learning goals. Each path includes:

- **Recommended order** of tutorials
- **Hands-on exercises** to practice skills
- **Real-world examples** from published research
- **Milestone projects** to demonstrate mastery

Beginner Path
--------------

**Goal**: Become comfortable with basic spatial transcriptomics analysis

**Duration**: ~2-3 weeks with regular practice

**Topics**:

- Data loading and quality control
- Basic visualization
- Simple spatial analysis
- Cell type annotation

:doc:`Start Beginner Path → <beginner>`

Intermediate Path
-----------------

**Goal**: Master common analytical workflows

**Duration**: ~4-6 weeks

**Topics**:

- Advanced visualization techniques
- Spatial domain identification
- Cell communication analysis
- Multi-sample comparison

:doc:`Start Intermediate Path → <intermediate>`

Advanced Path
-------------

**Goal**: Become an expert in complex spatial analyses

**Duration**: ~6-8 weeks

**Topics**:

- Batch integration strategies
- Custom workflow development
- Method comparison and validation
- Advanced computational techniques
