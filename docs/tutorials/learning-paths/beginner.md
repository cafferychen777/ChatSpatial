### Phase 2: Exploring Relationships (Week 1-2)

#### Step 3: Making Beautiful Pictures
**Tutorial:** [Visualization Tutorial](../core/visualization_tutorial.md)  
**Time:** 45-75 minutes  
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐☆☆☆

**What you'll achieve:**
- Create publication-ready figures through simple requests
- Customize colors, layouts, and styles conversationally
- Generate multiple visualization types for different purposes
- Save and export figures for presentations

**Key Conversation Skills:**
- "Can you create a nice plot of my cell types?"
- "Make the colors more publication-ready"
- "Can you adjust the layout to be cleaner?"
- "Save this as a high-resolution figure"

**Success Indicator:** You can create and customize beautiful visualizations through natural conversation.

---

#### Step 4: How Cells Talk to Each Other
**Tutorial:** [Cell Communication Analysis](../analysis/cell_communication_analysis.md)  
**Time:** 75-90 minutes  
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐☆☆

**What you'll achieve:**
- Understand how cells send signals to each other
- Identify important communication pathways in your tissue
- Discover which cells are the main "talkers" and "listeners"
- Visualize communication networks spatially

**Key Conversation Skills:**
- "How do my cells communicate with each other?"
- "Which pathways are most active?"
- "Can you show me the communication network?"
- "What does this mean biologically?"

**Success Indicator:** You can discover and interpret cell communication patterns in your tissue.

### Phase 3: Building Confidence (Week 2)

#### Step 5: Practice and Integration
**Time:** 60-90 minutes  
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐☆☆

**What you'll do:**

- Apply all learned skills to a new dataset

- Practice asking follow-up questions based on results

- Combine different analysis types in one conversation

- Troubleshoot common issues independently

**Practice Exercises:**

1. **Complete Analysis Flow:** Load → Preprocess → Find cell types → Explore communication → Visualize

2. **Question Chain Practice:** Ask follow-up questions based on each result

3. **Comparison Analysis:** "How does this region differ from that one?"

4. **Biological Interpretation:** "What does this tell us about the biology?"

**Success Indicator:** You can conduct a complete spatial analysis independently through conversation.
