# Learning Paths: Your Guided Journey Through Spatial Analysis
{: .fs-7 }

Structured learning paths to guide you through ChatSpatial from beginner to expert. Each path provides a complete curriculum with time estimates, practice exercises, and clear progression milestones.

## Choose Your Path

### [🌱 Beginner Path](beginner.html)
**For:** New users with no coding experience  
**Time:** 4-6 hours over 1-2 weeks  
**Focus:** Conversation-based learning, basic analysis, visualization

**You'll master:**
- Loading data through conversation
- Identifying cell types and spatial domains  
- Creating beautiful visualizations
- Understanding basic spatial biology concepts

**Success outcome:** Independent analysis through natural conversation

---

### [🔬 Intermediate Path](intermediate.html)  
**For:** Users comfortable with basics wanting advanced methods  
**Time:** 6-8 hours over 2-3 weeks  
**Focus:** Method selection, statistical analysis, integration

**You'll master:**
- Advanced spatial statistics (Moran's I, LISA, Ripley's K)
- Spatial gene set enrichment analysis
- Method comparison and selection
- Multi-sample analysis and integration

**Success outcome:** Choose optimal methods for specific research questions

---

### [🚀 Advanced Path](advanced.html)
**For:** Experienced users ready for cutting-edge research  
**Time:** 8-12 hours over 3-4 weeks  
**Focus:** Machine learning, temporal analysis, multi-modal integration

**You'll master:**
- GASTON neural network approaches
- RNA velocity and trajectory analysis
- Multi-modal data integration
- Research-quality workflow design

**Success outcome:** Design and execute publication-ready studies

## How Learning Paths Work

### Structured Progression
- **Phase-based learning** with clear milestones
- **Time estimates** for planning your schedule
- **Prerequisites checklist** before starting
- **Success indicators** to track progress

### Practice-Oriented
- **Real conversation examples** from each tutorial
- **Practice exercises** to reinforce concepts  
- **Integration challenges** combining multiple methods
- **Troubleshooting guides** for common issues

### Research-Focused
- **Biological interpretation** emphasis throughout
- **Method selection guidance** for research questions
- **Validation strategies** for computational results
- **Publication preparation** at advanced levels

## Getting Started

1. **Assess your current level** using the descriptions above
2. **Check prerequisites** for your chosen path
3. **Set aside dedicated learning time** - consistency matters more than intensity
4. **Follow the structured progression** - each step builds on previous learning
5. **Practice with your own data** once you complete each phase

## Need Help Choosing?

### Start with Beginner if you:
- Are new to spatial transcriptomics
- Prefer learning through conversation
- Want to focus on biological insights
- Have limited computational experience

### Jump to Intermediate if you:
- Understand basic spatial concepts
- Want to learn method selection
- Need statistical analysis capabilities
- Plan to compare multiple approaches

### Begin with Advanced if you:
- Have research experience in spatial biology
- Need cutting-edge computational methods  
- Plan to publish computational studies
- Want to develop novel analysis approaches
