Overview
--------

These core tutorials teach you the essential skills needed to work with spatial transcriptomics data in ChatSpatial. Each tutorial is designed to be completed in 15-30 minutes.

What You'll Learn
-----------------

1. **Data Management**

   - Loading different data formats (H5AD, Visium, MERFISH)
   - Quality control and filtering
   - Data preprocessing and normalization

2. **Visualization**

   - Creating spatial plots
   - Customizing colors and styles
   - Generating publication-ready figures

3. **Basic Analysis**

   - Identifying spatially variable genes
   - Computing spatial statistics
   - Neighborhood analysis

Prerequisites
-------------

Before starting these tutorials:

- ChatSpatial installed and configured
- Basic understanding of spatial transcriptomics concepts
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces

Tutorial Order
--------------

We recommend completing these tutorials in order:

1. **Data Loading** - Start here if you're new to ChatSpatial
2. **Visualization** - Learn to create effective plots
3. **Spatial Statistics** - Analyze spatial patterns

Each tutorial builds on concepts from previous ones.
