# Archived Documentation Directory

This directory contains historical documentation files that were previously scattered in the root directory. These documents are preserved for reference and project history.

## Directory Structure

### `/reports/` - Historical Test and Analysis Reports
- **`SCANVI_TEST_REPORT.md`**: Comprehensive testing report for scANVI annotation method
  - 80% test success rate with detailed analysis
  - Includes performance observations and improvement suggestions
  - Generated by: `archived_tests/scanvi/test_scanvi_comprehensive.py`

- **`TANGRAM_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`**: Improvement plan for Tangram spatial mapping method
  - User experience enhancements and error handling improvements
  - Related to testing in `archived_tests/tangram/`

- **`TANGRAM_TESTING_REPORT.md`**: Testing results and validation for Tangram method
  - Method validation and integration testing results

- **`cellassign_test_results.json`**: JSON results from CellAssign method testing
  - Structured test data from comprehensive validation

### `/historical/` - Historical Reference Files
*Note: Core AI configuration files (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, llms-full.txt) have been moved back to the root directory as they are actively used.*

This directory is reserved for truly historical documentation that is no longer actively referenced.

## Purpose of Archiving

These documents were archived to:
1. **Maintain Clean Root**: Keep the main directory focused on current documentation
2. **Preserve History**: Retain important project development history
3. **Reference Material**: Provide context for past decisions and implementations
4. **Documentation Evolution**: Show progression of project documentation

## Current Documentation

Active documentation is maintained in `/docs/` directory:
- `/docs/modules/`: Current API and module documentation
- `/docs/reports/`: Current analysis and status reports
- `/docs/development/`: Current development guides
- `/docs/reference/`: Current reference materials

## Migration Notes

- Historical reports provide context for current method implementations
- Configuration files show evolution of AI integration approaches
- Test reports demonstrate validation strategies that influenced current testing
- These files are primarily for historical reference

## Usage Guidelines

- These archived documents may contain outdated information
- For current project information, refer to `/docs/` directory
- Historical reports can provide insight into method development process
- Configuration files show evolution of AI assistant integration
