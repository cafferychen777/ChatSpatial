## Test Results by Dataset

### seqfish_developmental

- ❌ **preprocessing**: FAILED - The 'n_components' parameter of PCA must be an int in the range [0, inf), a float in the range (0.0, 1.0), a str among {'mle'} or None. Got -1 instead.
- ✅ **spatial**: PASSED (17.33s)
  - Spatial neighbors calculated
  - Spatial autocorrelation for 100 genes
  - Neighborhood enrichment computed
- ✅ **visualization**: PASSED (0.61s)
  - UMAP plot created
  - Spatial plot created
- ✅ **gene_analysis**: PASSED (0.12s)
  - Marker genes computed
  - Gene signature scoring

### benchmark_500x1k

- ✅ **preprocessing**: PASSED (42.24s)
  - QC metrics calculated
